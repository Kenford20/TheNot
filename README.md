# TheNot: Your Next Wedding Planner

[TheNot](https://wedding-approuter.vercel.app/) is not TheKnot... but also is as it's a clone of [theknot.com](https://www.theknot.com/).
Using the power of the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/), I've taken up this full stack hobby project to attempt to recreate portions of this popular wedding planning platform.

It is scaffolded with `create-t3-app` ([repo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app)) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) at https://wedding-approuter.vercel.app/. Everything from the design to the layout to the modeling of the data/schemas were done from scratch and by solely looking at and tinkering with the TheKnot website.
